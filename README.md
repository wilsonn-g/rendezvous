## Front End

Using the Google-recommended approach of a single activity and many fragments for Android.

### Front-End Setup

Download Android Studio here: <https://developer.android.com/studio>    

**Note**: You will need Java/JRE since the project is written in Java, but hopefully you have that from CPEN 221.  

To emulate the app on a virtual device, you will need to pick where the **API Level >= 28**, since the app is currently declared to be of that minSDK level in the manifest file. A good choice of virtual device is a Pixel 2 XL since @mebesius has one on Andoid 10 as of the moment.  

## Back-End

NodeJS, Express, AWS
